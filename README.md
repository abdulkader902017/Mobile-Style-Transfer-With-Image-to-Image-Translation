# Mobile-Style-Transfer-With-Image-to-Image-Translation
In this repository you will find a series of articles that present the development of a Mobile Image-to-Image Translation system based on a Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN). Weâ€™ll build a CycleGAN that can perform unpaired image-to-image translation, as well as show you some entertaining yet academically deep examples.
